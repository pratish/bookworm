Using simple shapes and solid colors, Laura’s method streamlines the traditional quilting process for beautiful quilts in less time. Quilt tops come together quickly with large-scale cuts of fabric and as little piecing as possible, making these projects perfect for beginners. Advanced quilters can delve into modern techniques such as creating curved lines and working with negative space rather than intricate quilting blocks. From chic wall hangings to cozy crib-size and queen-size quilts, every project doubles as a work of art. Fueled by her minimalist lifestyle traveling the United States in her Airstream trailer, Laura’s designs reflect the striking landscapes of the American West. The Arches Queen Quilt showcases the dramatic curves found in Arches National Park in Utah. The Lone Pine Pillow, with its range of triangles, was inspired by the Sierra Nevada mountains, and the Sand Dollar Table Runner was sparked by a beach in Big Sur, California. Follow Laura’s insightful design tips, and soon you’ll start to see inspiration everywhere. With illustrated step-by-step instructions and in-depth tutorials, this book is an essential resource for the modern quilter.",

        "description": "More than 20 inspired quilting and sewing patterns As a generation of mostly self-taught, creative women takes to the world of fabric, quilting and sewing are joining forces in a way that they never have before. Long-time quilters, committed to their craft for decades, are starting to experiment with a bit of home sewing or simple sewing for their grandchildren. The younger side of the sewing community is embracing the world of patchwork and quilting, a world that once seemed inaccessible or even undesirable to younger seamstresses. With Fabric & Thread seamlessly bridges the language and intimidation gap between these two crafts and delivers a unique collection of projects that appeal to sewers and quilters alike. Featuring 20 new projects, With Fabric & Thread marries the nomenclature of both sewing and quilting to create an effortless set of instructions that anyone can follow. Plus, a special section features six patterns that can be accomplished two different ways: one using sewing techniques and one using quilting techniques. The result is two unique looks from a single pattern. Provides an excellent stepping-off point for sewers learning to quilt, and quilters learning to sew Chic projects, well-styled photos, and modern illustrations speak to this increasingly unified audience Good, basic, understandable instructions If you're a quilter experimenting with sewing, or vice versa, the beautiful designs in With Fabric & Thread give you everything you need to bring these two crafts together to make unique and inspired projects.",
